 H-->Hyper

 T-->Text

 M-->Markup(it means here we will use some annotations or tag to represent the content)

 L-->Language


HTML is a type of Markup language(!Not programming language) that uses some annotations or tags to represent content and linked those content together

--> meta tag always go inside the head tag and also the information which is important for developer not for user is 
    store inside the meta tag

    --> View port is the total width of the screen


Tag is a type of keyword that specifies or tell what is the type of content and attribute is a case sensitive


-->The heading element used to specify the importance of the content below them so lower the 
number higher the importance

--> All pages should begin with <!DOCTYPE html>. 
This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications.

-->Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

---> All page content elements that should be rendered to the page go inside the body element.
 However, other important information goes inside the head element.

 ---> The title element determines what browsers show in the title bar or tab for the page.

 --> lang attribute is used to indicate that the language of the web page is english

-->The p element is used to write paragraph in website

 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 -->HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make
  your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

--> A tag not having closing tag is known as self closing tag

--> You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element
  Ex: <a href='https://freecodecamp.org'>X</a> would link to freecodecamp.org
   Here X represent the text must be added because by clicking in that link we will
   redirected to freecodecamp

   -->To make any text having link just place the anchor tag in between the desired text with desire href
   --> Target attribute in anchor tag help us to go to a new tag
   --> target="_blank" it tells that to open the page in another tab

   <section 
     <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
      <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
      <p>See more <a target="_blank" href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a> in our gallery.</p>
      <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">
      <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">
      </a>
      </section>

     --> When you add a lower rank heading element to the page, 
         it's implied that you're starting a new subsection 


     --> here by using ul we can create list in HTML
              <ul>
          <li>milk</li>
          <li>cheese</li>
           </ul>

        where li is used to add items in the list

    --> The figure element represents self-contained content and will
        allow you to associate an image with a caption

        And caption can be added by figcaption tag

     --> The <em> tag is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
      A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress.          

     --> The strong element is used to indicate that
      some text is of strong importance or urgent. 

      Use of strong tag:While many browsers will display this text in bold by default,
       the use of the <strong> element allows assistive
        technologies (such as screen readers) to identify the emphasized text as having 
        a higher level of importance, making it useful for accessibility.

     --> Just like editText in android is used to collect information from  
       user. In the same way  web form to collect information from users in HTML

     The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example, <form action="/submit-url"></form> tells the browser that
      the form data should be sent to the path /submit-url.   


   ---> The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements
    input elements are self-closing and do not need closing tags.

    There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the 
    type attribute in the input tag

    In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must give 
    the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted. 
    For example, you could use the following syntax for an email address text field: <input type="text" name="email">.  
    
    Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input.
     For example, <input type="text" placeholder="Email address">.

    To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the 
    required attribute to an input element. There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. 
    Instead, just add the word required to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes. 


    --> Use the button element to create a clickable button. For example, <button>Click Here</button> creates a button with the text Click Here.
      The default behavior of clicking a form button without any attributes submits the form to the location specified in the form's action attribute.

      However, relying on default behavior may cause confusion. 
      Add the type attribute with the value submit to the button to make it clear that it is a submit button.

      We can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options.

      In HTML, the <label> element is used in conjunction with form elements to provide a text description or 
      label for an associated form control, such as an input field or a checkbox.

      This association helps users understand what each form field is for and makes it easier to interact
       with forms, especially for people using screen readers or other assistive technologies

      The id attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each id attribute's value must
      be unique from all other id values for the entire page 

      The name attribute in radio buttons (or radio input elements) serves two primary purposes:
             
             1.Radio buttons are used to create a set of mutually exclusive options, where a user can select
              only one option from the group. The name attribute is used to group related radio buttons together. 
              When radio buttons share the same name attribute, they are considered part of the same group, 
              and the user can select only one option from that group.

             2. When a user selects a radio button within a group and submits a form, the name attribute is used to
              identify which option the user has chosen. The selected option's name attribute and its associated 
              value attribute (if specified) are sent to the server as part of the form data. This allows the 
              server-side script or application to process the user's choice. 

        The value attribute in a radio button (or radio input element) serves a crucial role in the form submission process. 
        It defines the value that will be sent to the server when the radio button is selected and the form is submitted.

     The main purpose of the value attribute is given as:
        
         1.Radio buttons are typically used in groups where the user can choose one option from several. 
         To distinguish between the different options in the group, each radio button should have a unique value attribute. 
         When a user selects a particular radio button, the value associated with that radio button is sent
          to the server as part of the form data.

         2. When the user selects one of the radio buttons and submits the form, the value attribute of the selected
          radio button is included in the form data. This is essential for processing the form on the server-side. 
          It allows the server to determine which option the user selected. 

     Like radio buttons, form data for selected checkboxes are name / value attribute pairs. 
     While the value attribute is optional, it's best practice to include it with any checkboxes or radio buttons on the page.


   --> In HTML, inline elements are elements that are designed to be used within the flow of text and do 
      not create a new block-level container for content  

      Inline elements typically do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
       They are used to style or provide additional information about specific parts of the text


    --> The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. 
    fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.  

    The <fieldset> element in HTML is like a special box that helps organize those questions
     or things to fill in. It's like putting all the questions that are about one topic in a nice box with a label on top. 

     The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. 
     It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form.

   -->There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself.
    You can nest the text within a label element and add a for attribute
     with the same value as the input element's id attribute.  

  --> In order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the checked attribute to it. 
  There's no need to set a value to the checked attribute. Instead, just add the word checked to the input element,
   making sure there is space between it and other attributes.     


   --> In summary, the <footer> element in HTML is used to define footer content at the bottom of a webpage or within specific sections.
    It is a valuable tool for providing additional context, information, and navigation options to users and enhancing
     the overall structure and accessibility of a webpage.


  --> To create table we must follow the below practice:
         1.The table heading must be under the "thead" tag
         2. The actual content of the table must be inside the "tbody" tag
         3.  The bottom part of the table must be under "tfooter" tag 
    
    And generally the heading of the table must be bold and for that we will use th not td
