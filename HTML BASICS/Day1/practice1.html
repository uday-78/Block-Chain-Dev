    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds,[7] 
    the grandson of statistician Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds, and the great-grandson of 
    journalist and soldier Toivo Karanko. His parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. 
    His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. He was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize–winning American chemist,
     although in the book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution, he is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts 
     cartoon character", noting that this made him "half Nobel Prize winning chemist and half blanket-carrying cartoon character".</p>
